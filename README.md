# Everyday Workflow Tools in Unity
Building games is a time-consuming, complicated, and collaborative process. On massive projects, engineers often build tools like level editors, data visualizers, and automated tasks to enable their teammates to produce a game.

But tools are not just for AAA titles; we can always build small tools throughout the development process to increase productivity and make designing content more fun. One hidden gem of the Unity game engine is the extensibility of its editor. We can use C# scripting, just like our game scripts, to add functionality and graphical interfaces to our Unity workspace.

If you're an engineer or Unity developer, come learn how to make tools that you and your team can use every day in your workflow. If you're an artist, designer, or other non-technical game developer, come learn what kinds of tools you can expect your engineers to be capable of creating!

## Why would you make a tool?

- Automate something
- Add technical support (debugging, QA, etc.)
- Tweak the engine's default functionality
- Create an interface for designing content
